### Hi! I'm Chatter Droid ! Nice to see you !
Wanna see my projects ? Let's go !

## My projects
First, I have made [OpenWhitespace](https://github.com/chatter-droid/openwhitespace), a Whitespace interpreter. Try to guess in wich language i did it !
Second, I have made [Illusion Browser](https://github.com/chatter-droid/illusion-browser), a web browser for Android.
And finally, I have [snack](https://chatter-droid.github.io/snack/), a command line interface that print things on the screen. It was originally a joke, but i published it on  GitHub.

## I hope you like my projects, see you !

oh that was stressing...
