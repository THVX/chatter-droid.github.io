### Chatter Droid 🤖

### Hi there 👋
### I'm Chatter Droid 🤖! 😄 
### I have created 5 repos for now: the [OpenWhitespace Interpreter](https://github.com/chatter-droid/openwhitespace), [snack](https://github.com/chatter-droid/snack), [Illusion Browser](https://github.com/chatter-droid/illusion-browser), [Alpha](https://github.com/chatter-droid/Alpha) and [Neth (Nomad Ether)](https://github.com/chatter-droid/neth-client) ! ⚡⚡

## My projects

* Basically, OpenWhitespace is just an interpreter like others. But it runs WhiteSpace, an exotic language. (Like Brainfuck, Ook, or LOLCODE). 🔭
* snack is a command line interface that prints thing on the screen. 💬
* My most precious project is Alpha (or AlphaC++). It's a C/C++ library designed for beginners to create a console apps with an esasy syntax.❤️
* Illusion Browser is a web browser for Android. 👯
* Nomad Ether is an ethereum client based on Go Ethereum (WORK IN PROGRESS).
# Try to guess in which language I did them ! 🤔

## Alpha 'Hello World !' example
```
#include "Alpha.h"
using namespace Alpha;

Func main() {
  SPrint("Hello World !");
}
```
## I hope you like my projects, see you !

oh that was stressing...
